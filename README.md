I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to quickly create a React environment.
Much of the code in this project is generated by this tool. The code I added can mostly be found inside `src/components`
For my CSS I have used [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)


### To Run:

Prerequisite: The following backend API should be running locally https://github.com/mediasuitenz/client-coding-exercise/blob/master/README.md

1. Clone this repo: 
```
$ git clone git@github.com:alichur/trending-articles.git
```
2. Move into the directory and install the dependencies:
```
$ cd trending-articles
$ npm i
```
3. Launch the application:
```
$ npm start
```

4. The application can now be viewed at `http://localhost:3001/`

Note, this application runs on port 3001. If this port is clashing with another running application in your environment it can be changed inside `package.json` 'start' script.


### `Notes for reviewer`

I stopped developing before finishing this assignment in an attempt to stick to the suggested time limit of 2 hours.
As a result there are a few remaining tasks:

- After clicking article title it should route to new page and display article (rather than temporary alert box)
- Need to handle errors and non-200 responses for fetch with styled user friendly error.
- API string should be stored in a const and not repeated. Perhaps move API code into external service
- Header, footer, nice scroll animation 
- Media query to display articles side by side for desktop, and hover effects for mouseover.
